## Setup
Successfully connected the servers! I had a working MySQL Database for Azure and GCP which can be seen with the pictures provided. I manually created the tables, which I later realized I shouldn't have done since we were creating them within the python code.
The python code stopped working for me due to unknown reasons. I used the correct passwords and everything, however there was an issue connecting to the database because +pymysql didn't exist apparently. I used a very basic database structure which you can see in the sql code that I provided.
